## 💡 Inspiration
IT operations teams face a fragmented, manual incident resolution process—reviewing tickets in ServiceNow, accessing servers, hopping between observability tools, and searching for automation scripts. This leads to prolonged MTTR (industry average: 4 hours), operational strain (60% of time on manual tasks), and high downtime costs ($5,600/minute). We built OpsBuddy to:

Unify incident management workflows.
Automate diagnostics and resolutions.
Empower teams with intelligent, actionable insights.

## ⚙️ What It Does
OpsBuddy transforms incident management by:

Offering a unified platform for incident review, diagnostics, and resolution.
Providing real-time incident status, impacted services, observability data, historical analysis, and automation options.
Enabling natural language interaction (chat/voice) and MS Teams integration for seamless support.
Reducing MTTR and operational costs through AI-driven automation.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
OpsBuddy was developed using:

A backend to integrate with ServiceNow, observability tools, and automation libraries.
A frontend for an interactive, real-time dashboard.
An AI engine to process incident data and recommend actions.
MS Teams API for seamless workflow integration.
The result is a scalable, intelligent platform that simplifies IT operations.
